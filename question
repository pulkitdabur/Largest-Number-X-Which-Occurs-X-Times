Largest Number X Which Occurs X Times
Given an array A consisting of N integers, you should return the biggest value X, which occurs in A exactly X times. If there is no such value, you should return 0.

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

Example
Example 1:

Input: 
[3, 8, 2, 3, 3, 2]
Output: 
3
Explanation: 
The value 2 occurs exactly two times and the value 3 occurs exactly three times. Meanwhile, the maximum of 2 and 3 is 3 so the answer is 3.
Example 2:

Input: 
[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
Output: 
0
Explanation: 
There is no value which meets the task conditions so the answer is 0.
